### About LaF0rge

I'm doing software and embedded electronics development both as my main job (at [sysmocom](https://sysmocom.de/) 

The main focus of my activities is within the [osmocom](https://osmocom.org/) (Open Source Mobile Communications) project, which I helped to start in the 2008-2010 timeframe.

I don't really like github as a centralized (and proprietary) single point of failure platform.  I am a a believer in the distributed internet with self-hosting.  Hence, the majority of my work is not actually here as personal repositories, but

* At https://gitea.osmocom.org/ (our osmocom main code repo)
  * while I'm contributing to many of the repos there, my personal repos are at https://gitea.osmocom.org/laforge/
* some older stuff on https://git.gnumonks.org/

However, given that many projects have chosen github as their platform to host their code, I have to use it occasionally - mostly use github as a means to send pull requests.  You will find forks of such projects and my patches/contributions in there - usually until I get around to deleting them after the merge has happened.
